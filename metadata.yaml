description: Born in London, Chesterton was educated at St. Paul's, but never went
  to college. He went to art school. In 1900, he was asked to contribute a few magazine
  articles on art criticism, and went on to become one of the most prolific writers
  of all time. He wrote a hundred books, contributions to 200 more, hundreds of poems,
  including the epic Ballad of the White Horse, five plays, five novels, and some
  two hundred short stories, including a popular series featuring the priest-detective,
  Father Brown. In spite of his literary accomplishments, he considered himself primarily
